Please take a few moments to read the following instructions.VirtualTone will be delivering your services over your current Internet and network infrastructure. This requires a VirtualTone Technician to work with the IT staff responsible for maintaining your router, switches, cabling, commonly known as your network infrastructure. In some cases adding cable drops, changing routers and switches may be necessary. If you do not have an IT staff that maintains your network a third party can be contacted to assist you in preparing your network, separate fees will apply. If you require assistant please contact your Sales Engineer to schedule an onsite evaluation before the testing phase of the install. Technical knowledge and troubleshooting of routers, switches and cabling is a must, choosing to do it yourself may cause delays if you do not have this knowledge. VirtualTone installations are scheduled Monday through Friday 10am - 4pm CST, with the exception of holidays. Customers with multiple offices requesting the turn up (activate VirtualTone for inbound and outbound calling) of partial offices may be requested.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><hr /><span style="background-color:#DCDCDC;color:#000000">THIS CUSTOMER ORDER IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ABOVE-SIGNED AND SKL SERVICES, INC.
