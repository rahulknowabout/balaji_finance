</b><i> The Court Service is an executive agency of the Lord Chancellor's Department, providing administrative support to a number of courts and tribunals in England and Wales, including the High Court, the Crown Court and the county courts.

While a judge or a judicial officer determines the outcome of cases coming before these courts and tribunals, the staff of the Court Service carries much of the supporting administrative work out.  This introduction outlines briefly the services we provide, tell you a little about what you can expect when you come to court and provides you with some useful contact numbers.  We know that coming to court can be stressful, but we try to do all we can to make the experience as easy as possible.  

The Court Service has a Charter, which sets out in detail the standards of service and performance you can expect to find in your dealings with the court.  We have produced leaflets that set out the standards, which apply, to the High Court, Probate Registries, the tribunals, all county courts and Crown Court centres, and Family cases.

The majority of cases dealt with by the Court Service come before the county courts.  There are approximately 230 county courts throughout England and Wales and it is here that all but the most complicated civil law proceedings are handled.  

Civil cases include claims for debt, personal injury, breach of contract concerning goods or property, family issues such as divorce or adoption, and the repossession of houses.

There is a monetary limit for small claims cases, which is reviewed from time to time, but the county court staff will tell you what the current limit is.  The case begins with the issue of a claim by the person who is owed the money, and is directed to a defendant, the person whom it is alleged owes the money.

A solicitor who provides police station advice as a duty solicitor or representation at a magistrates' court is bound by Parts VII and VIII of the Legal Aid Board Duty Solicitor Arrangements 1992 as to the scope of service to be provided, including paragraphs 51 (defendant's right to instruct other solicitor) and 60 (continued instructions).  The Duty Solicitor Arrangements are contained in the Legal Aid Handbook.  Solicitors attending at court or police stations as duty solicitors may have clients referred to them by court officers and others may directly approach defendants at court and may subsequently act for the client at their office in the usual way.

Where a solicitor is representing a client in a bail case under the duty solicitor scheme where legal aid has been refused, the duty solicitor should limit representation to re-applying for legal aid.  This applies even where the duty solicitor feels the client has a good case for obtaining bail because, by refusing legal aid, the court has already decided the defendant does not require legal representation.

The 34th Update of the Civil Procedure Rules introduces a number of notable changes to procedures including the following:

A new Practice Direction 5B replaces the existing one.  It provides for deletion of the auto-response facility and issues a new section 2 which makes provision for use of the online forms service which may be used for both submission of forms and for submission of documents.
 
A new rule 7.12 which provides for a practice direction to make provision for claims to be started electronically.  The accompanying Practice Direction 7E will provide for the continuation of the service known as Money Claim Online which is presently operating as a pilot scheme. 

Practice Direction 23 is amended to extend the duration of the existing Telephone Hearings Pilot Scheme at Newcastle Combined Court Centre and to introduce the scheme at Bedford County Court and Luton County Court. 

A new rule 30.8 which requires any proceedings which raise an issue of competition law relating to the application of Article 81 or Article 82 of the EEC Treaty to be transferred to the Chancery Division. 

A new rule 34.13A which prescribes the procedure for applications to the
